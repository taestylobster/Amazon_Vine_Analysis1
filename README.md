# Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to look at amazon reviews for videogame products and determine how many 5 star reviews exist, how many paid 5 star reviews exist, how many unpaid 5 star reviews exist, and lastly, the percentage of paid vs unpaid 5 star reviews. This analysis was also done assuming that the procuct had greater than a 50% helpful to total review ratio. This was done using AWS, pgAdmin, google collab, and jupyter noteboook.

# Results:
* The total amount of 5-star reviews were 65,379
* The total amount of 5-star vine(paid) reviews were 104
* The total amount of 5-star non-Vine(unpaid) reviews were 65,275
* The total percentage of 5-star vine reviews was 0.0016%
* The total percentage of 5-star non-vine reviews was 0.9984%

# Summary
After analysis, there doesn't appear to be a bias for video game reviews in the vine program. To ensure this, additional analysis could be done to determine if there is any bias for any of the review grades (1-star through 5-star) between vine and non-vine reviews.
